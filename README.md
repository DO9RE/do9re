# 👋 Welcome to my GitHub profile!

## 🧭 Who I am

My name is Richard. Born in the late 1980s and blind since birth, technology has never been just a tool for me. It has been my connection to the world. For nearly two decades, I’ve been supporting blind and severely visually impaired individuals in gaining digital confidence, whether through screen readers, Braille displays, or accessible workflows on mobile devices.

I’m the co-founder and managing director of 2of1, a company focused on assistive technologies and training services. Our mission: helping people remove barriers in everyday life through knowledge, the right tools, and real empowerment.

Before starting my own business, I worked as an IT trainer, programmer, and product developer for two well-known German companies in the assistive technology sector.

This GitHub account is strictly personal – a place for experiments, CLI tweaks, and sharing ideas beyond the professional scope.

## 🛠️ What defines my tech background

- Training & consulting in accessible IT, especially for people with visual impairments  
- In-depth knowledge of screen readers (JAWS, NVDA, VoiceOver, Orca), Braille tech, and mobile accessibility  
- Proficient in Linux environments, the command line, Bash, PHP, and a little bit of C.
- Strong focus on digital ethics, open-source tools, and usability over hype

## 📡 Amateur Radio

When not working in the digital space, I enjoy being active on the airwaves. Licensed under the callsign DO9RE, I participate in both HF and VHF/UHF amateur radio. For me, ham radio blends technical curiosity with global communication and a sense of timeless exploration.

## 🤝 Values & Approach

I believe technology should not be a privilege. It must be accessible and reliable – especially for those who face daily barriers. Digital inclusion is a right, not a luxury.

> “Good technology doesn’t care if you can see it.”

## Support my work

If you find my projects useful and would like to support what I do, you can help me keep things moving with a voluntary donation. Most of my programming and research happens in my free time, driven by curiosity and the goal of building practical tools that are genuinely usable.

Your support directly helps me invest in new hardware and test equipment—especially amateur radio gear—so I can explore, improve, and develop accessibility for blind and visually impaired users. And sometimes it simply goes toward coffee, which helps a lot during long coding sessions. :-)
